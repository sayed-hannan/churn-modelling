# Project Title
A churn Prediction Model 

## Description
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn for [Company/Industry]. By identifying customers at risk of churning, the company can take proactive measures to retain them, reducing customer acquisition costs and boosting overall revenue.

## Data
- Used public dataset from kaggle.
- Data is in CSV format.
- There are total 14 features and target feature is **Exited**

## Methodology
**Steps involve in project**
-Data Exploration and Cleanning
-Data Analysis
-Feature Transormation
-Model selection and training
-Model evaluation

## Result
- Chosen Model is Random Forest.
- key evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- Important features of Chun Prediction Mode are **Age,**



## Dependencies
- Python
- Pandas
- Sklearn
- Matplotlib
- Streamlit

## Usage
Project includes scripts fro data loading, processing and for model training, which can be run one be one to test each step or main scirpt which run all these
steps from start to end and save model.
For quick overview you can also use run training.ipynb.
For visual interaction you can run streamlit app.
